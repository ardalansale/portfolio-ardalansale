I focus on truly understanding what people need, then adapt my solutions to create value for both users and the business. Function always drives my work. Beautiful design means nothing if it doesn't actually solve problems or make life easier. I work across both UX and frontend because I want to control the entire experience, from initial user journeys to final interactive details. My goal is creating interfaces so intuitive and satisfying that people naturally recommend them to others. I'm constantly exploring new creative tools to bring into my workflow. AI has become an invaluable collaborator in my process and I'm currently learning Blender to bring 3D elements into web projects."

        title: "I enjoy",

The gym has become my morning ritual, especially since I started incorporating some light running into my routine. Gaming is my go-to for unwinding on the weekends and Gran Turismo 7 has completely hooked me lately. Above everything else though, nothing beats the time I get to spend with my fianc√©e, family and the people closest to me."
